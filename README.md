# 🎵 Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify and segment Spotify songs into their respective genres using machine learning algorithms. The entire workflow is built and executed in **Google Colab**, making it easy to use, reproduce, and deploy.

## 📌 Project Description

Music classification by genre is a popular task in music information retrieval. This project uses a dataset of Spotify songs (including features like tempo, danceability, energy, etc.) to train a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a given song.

We use supervised learning methods to train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3
- 📘 Google Colab
- 🧠 Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- 🐼 Pandas (Data handling)
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- 📁 CSV Dataset (From Kaggle or other sources)

---

## 📁 Dataset

You can use any public dataset of Spotify songs such as:

- [Kaggle: Spotify Dataset 1921-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Dataset should include features like: `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `acousticness`, `tempo`, `valence`, and `genre`.

Upload the dataset into Colab or mount it from Google Drive.
